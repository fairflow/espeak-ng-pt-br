**Why archived?**
- CLI app is deprecated (Streamlit web app is current)
- New guides are more comprehensive and up-to-date
- Kept for reference/historical purposes

## 📂 Existing Documentation (Unchanged)

### App-Specific (Root Directory)

- `APP_CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `VERSION_WORKFLOW.md` - Git workflow and versioning rules
- `CCS_TESTING_README.md` - Technical CCS testing framework

- `docs/guide.md` - eSpeak NG usage
- `docs/building.md` - Compiling eSpeak NG
- `docs/languages.md` - Supported languages
- etc. (all original eSpeak NG docs)

**Note**: `docs/` folder is for eSpeak NG documentation, `app-docs/` is for the app

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### For Non-Technical Users

**Before**: Had to navigate technical README files, command-line examples  
**After**: Clear USER_GUIDE.md with phone screenshots concepts, step-by-step instructions

### For Testers

**Before**: No structured testing guide  
**After**: Comprehensive TESTING_GUIDE.md with checklists and templates

### For Developers

**Before**: Information scattered across multiple files  
**After**: Single DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with complete setup and architecture

### For Everyone

**Before**: Unclear where to start  
**After**: app-docs/README.md navigation hub directs to correct guide
